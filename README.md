# Mitel5000SMDR  
Script for collecting the SMDR stream from a Mitel 5000 phone system

Run the python program and it will continue to run and and insert records to your local database as the users hang up the calls in real time.  
The program assumes the SMDR is streaming from a Mitel 5000 System on port 4000 with no PWD.
